# SMTool
Social media tool that gets tweets includes a specified string or searches for a user's tweets
You need to add your consumer key for authentication to the TwitterFunctions.cs for the program to run.
You get the authentication key from Twitter's developer page if you don't already know it.
It uses Tweetinvi plugin for Twitter API.
"Advanced search" part supports advanced Twitter commands such as "from:@username since:dd/mm/yy until:dd/mm/yy"
"Interaction graph" part is not implemented yet, I'm planning to do it at a later time. It will show different kind of graphs visualizing user activity on related social media platform.
Right now it supports only Twitter, but I plan to add features including Instagram and LinkedIn.
